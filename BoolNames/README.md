## Why readability is so important for us?
Many publications show us that programmers spend much more time reading code than writing. If that's true, it's very important to speed things up. This is the main reason why we should care about readability.

## How proper bool names can improve readability?
If you're reading code and you see a field or property called Active, you need to concentrate and find out what TRUE means (whether it means IsActive or IsNotActive).

If you see a field or property called IsActive - now you know exactly what true means.

Proper naming can save you time during the development process and even prevent you from making a mistake
