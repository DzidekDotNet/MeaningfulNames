Refactoring complex if statement to method/function is one of the easiest way to improve readability.

## Why readability is so important for us?
Many publications show us that programmers spend much more time reading code than writing. If that's true, it's very important to speed things up. This is the main reason why we should care about readability.

## How complex if can improve readability?
### While adding or modifying functions
Consider that you need to add some feature or change something...

First, you will look where you should add or change something, but you maybe don't need to focus on the complex if, you need to know if this is the place that you are interested in or not (where you will add or change something). 

If in code there are methods or functions which describe what this complex if does it is much easier for the next developer to their staff
### While finding bugs
If you have to fix the bugs and you read the code with complex if (without a description of what was the intention) it is hard to figure out if it is good code or not

But if you have a method with describes what was the intention and the complex if the inside has some mistake - it is easy to fix it
