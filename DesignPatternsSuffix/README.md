Don't mislead other programmers... Don't use design patterns suffix when you're not implementing these patterns

## How to deal with design patterns suffix?
A design pattern suffix cannot be added when code does not implement that pattern. Otherwise, discuss with your team whether design patterns will have suffixes or not.

I strongly recommend adding a design patterns suffix because:
- the suffix shows the intentions of other programmers
- during the modification, other programmers will know what the class with the suffix is responsible for
- reading the code will be the easiest because the suffix will tell you what the purpose of the class is
